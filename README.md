# CS204-Advanced-Programming

This repository contains my homework assignments and projects for the CS204 course - Advanced Programming. This course aims to provide programming experience and advanced techniques necessary for data structures and other junior and senior-level CS courses.

## Course Description

CS204 is a prerequisite for several CS courses, including data structures. It focuses on programming in C++. The course assumes a solid background in CS201 and will not review topics covered in that course.

### Topics Covered:

- Introduction (overview of basic concepts, Visual C++ environment, preprocessor directives, compiler, compiler options, linker, libraries, debugging)
- Pointers and dynamic memory allocation
- Linked lists
- Stacks and queues
- Templates, templated classes, and functions
- Advanced issues on classes and object-oriented programming
- Data representation, bitwise operations
- Inheritance, polymorphism, and advanced object-oriented design
- Exception handling
- Programming with threads
- Visual programming and graphical user interfaces

## Usage

Each homework assignment or project will have its own directory within this repository. Inside each directory, you'll find the necessary files, including any source code files, documentation, or additional resources required for the assignment.

## Development Environment

- Language: C++
- IDE: Clion
